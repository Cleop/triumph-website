## Background

Triumph is a junior school for rural children in Mowire, Ghana. The school welcomes volunteers from around the world to help support its growth and the improvement of the quality of the education of its children.

## What?

Create a website that enables prospective volunteers to apply to volunteer at Triumph. The website will also be a platform for information about the school and what volunteering there entails.

## Why?

At present, Triumph has no website of its own. In the past volunteers have come across the school via [Kids Worldwide](http://www.kidsworldwide.org/publication_details_idx.php?publication_id=33). However as they do not manage Kids Worldwide it means that they cannot amend the content/ look of the site as they may if they had their own. This site also features other volunteering projects meaning visitors to it have to look further to find Triumph before learning about it.

In recent years Triumph has seen a fall in volunteer numbers. This website is being built to try and rectify this fall.

## How?

This site will be a MVP.
- The core functionality will be a form for applicants to use.
- It will use handlebars for repetitive content (e.g. navbar, footer)
- The backend will use node
- It will be hosted on heroku
- It will be mobile-first

- At a later date it may feature an online donation feature
